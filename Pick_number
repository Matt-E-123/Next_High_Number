###Here the user will input the 9 digit number, this number will also be turned into an int
starting_number= raw_input("Hello friend! Please enter a nine digit number where no two digits are the same: ")
next_number = int(starting_number) + 1
digits1 = set(starting_number)
x = False

###While statement to setup a comparison between the set of starting number and the number when you add one
while not x:
    next_number += 1
    digits2 = set(str(next_number))
    x = len(digits2) == 9 and digits1 == digits2
    if next_number > 987654321:
        print ("The next highest number is: ", next_number)
    
    
if x:
    print(next_number)
else:
    print("Ya messed up somewhere! I'm sorry, man.")
